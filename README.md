CARILLON PLAYER FOR GBDK
------------------------

This was ported thanks to nitro2k01 (http://gbdev.gg8.se/forums/).

To use it:

1- Download Carillon Editor.

2- Create a music with Carillon Editor and save music.

3- build!

A modified bin2s will convert the carillon sav to asm code. 

If the sav file is called "music.b3.sav":

	music will fill bank 3
	
	samples will fill bank 4

Still no way to remove the samples if the song is not using them.
